## Description

This is the traditional game played around the country in the USA. 8-Ball is a game of two suits or categories of balls: stripes and solids. The objective of the game is to make all of your category of ball and then the 8-Ball.

The game is played with all 15 balls racked in a triangle. The order of balls in the rack varies by ruleset but in general, the 8-Ball must be in the center of the triangle in the 3rd row from the front, and the rest are randomized.
