## Description

Rotation means the balls are targeted in numerical order. This means the lowest numbered ball on the table is the current objective for the shooting player. They need to make contact with that ball before any other ball.

In 9-Ball there are 9 balls used and the rack has two rules generally: the 1 ball is at the front of the diamond shaped rack, and the 9 is in the center.
