title: "Shot Line"

## Definition

The shot line is the line at which the [object ball](object-ball) will travel after the [cue ball](cue-ball) strikes it. This can mean the line from the center of the [pocket](pocket) to the [object ball](object-ball), or sometimes from a rail, or other [object ball](object-ball). You're not always trying to pocket a ball on every shot, but there is always a shot line.

:::tip Tangent Line is derived from this
The [tangent line](tangent-line) is always derived from the shot line, because this is the point of contact between the [cue ball](cue-ball) and [object ball](object-ball).
