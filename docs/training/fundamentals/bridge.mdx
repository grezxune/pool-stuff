## What bridge do I use?

The bridge you use will vary depending upon the shot you are facing. Sometimes you need extra power - this will often result in a closed bridge of sorts. Sometimes you are close to a rail, so you may need to get creative with your bridge hand to support your cue properly.

:::warning  Important!
The most important thing to consider on any bridge: 

> Always make it as stable as you possibly can!

This stability level will change with akward shots and special shooting conditions, however for most shots you can support the cue extremely well with a few key points:

1. Keep your palm on the bed of the table
2. If you're on the rail, you likely want to use the rail to guide the cue, and you place your hand around it

## Two main bridges

## Alternate bridges

1. Rail bridge
    - Closed/Open
2. Between rail and bed of the table
3. Over a ball
