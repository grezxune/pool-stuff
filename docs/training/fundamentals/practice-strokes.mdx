## Slower is better!

You want to enter your shot "quietly" - meaning do not drop into your shot and begin rapidly flaily your cue back and forth as if you heat up the tires.

Drop into your shot and make sure things look right before moving the cue at all. From there, start a routine of 3-4 smooth, slow practice strokes. These strokes should be of similar look & feel to what your shot will be. All of this should be very well timed and smooth.
