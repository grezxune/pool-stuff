## Final details!

Just like every other sport, the follow through is extremely important. While [pulling the trigger](pulling-the-trigger), you want to make sure you drive your [cue](../../terminology/cue) through the [cue ball](../../terminology/cue-ball) about the same distance as your [final pull/backstroke](final-pull) was from the [cue ball](../../terminology/cue-ball).

This should happen in one smooth motion, no jitter or adjustment made to your stroke after contact with the [cue ball](../../terminology/cue-ball).

And by this, I mean don't strike the [cue ball](../../terminology/cue-ball) and then have an "oh yeah, I gotta push further" kind of moment, and then "finish" your follow through. No. That means you've hit or struck the [cue ball](../../terminology/cue-ball) and it already doesn't have the proper physics enacted upon it. You've lost that shot!

One other point on this: make sure there are no adjustments made to get your [cue](../../terminology/cue) back on the [shot line](../../terminology/shot-line) to make yourself feel better either. If you are following through and your [cue](../../terminology/cue) or [tip](../../terminology/tip) is off the [shot line](../../terminology/shot-line), that is something you need to work on - NOT just adjust your [cue](../../terminology/cue) back to the [shot line](../../terminology/shot-line) and call it good.

Instead, you want the motion of your [cue](../../terminology/cue) to be fluid from the back of your [final pull/backstroke](final-pull) through to the finishing position of your follow through.
