## Contact is almost made!

At this point you've pulled your [cue](../../terminology/cue) back to its furthest position for the shot, and now it needs to be driven through the [cue ball](../../terminology/cue-ball). The transition from performing the [final pull/backstroke](final-pull) to this step should be very fluid and natural.

Some players build their game such that they pause at the back of their [final pull/backstroke](final-pull), and some don't. There's a good range of options to choose from when building your own game here, but keep this in mind:

You do not want to go too fast so that your arm muscles end up pulling your arm off-line, and you don't want to pause too long such that it becomes unnatural. It should be like throwing a baseball - nice and fluid with a good [follow through](follow-through).

:::tip Push don't hit!
There's a very large and clear distinction between pushing through the [cue ball](../../terminology/cue-ball) and striking or hitting it.

By pushing through the [cue ball](../../terminology/cue-ball) you enact the proper action on it, and the speed and spin will more closely resemble the imagery you have in your mind when mapping the shot out.
