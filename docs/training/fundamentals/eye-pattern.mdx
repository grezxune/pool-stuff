## Where are we?

### Steps to get here
1. We've addressed the ball
2. stepped into our stance
3. entered quietly 
4. and are securely holding our cue in a bridge

:::info Also note
You haven't done a single [practice stroke](practice-strokes) yet.

## What's next?

Move only your eyes, nothing else to validate you are aligned properly and where you need to be. If something feels off and you feel the need to move in order to be aligned properly, get back up and start back at [ball address.](ball-address)
