## Description

Addressing the [cue ball](../../terminology/cue-ball) is the process of positioning your body in the proper place before [stepping into the shot](stepping-into-stance). Working this into your routine as something you do consistenly and the same is very important, as it gives the rest of your routine the same basis to start from.

## Actions

1. Find the line of the shot.
    - This may entail walking and standing behind the line from the object ball to the pocket.
1. **Stand behind the cue ball.** This is the best place to start. You can see the line of the shot and the angle of the cue ball to the object ball.
