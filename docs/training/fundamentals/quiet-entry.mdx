## Validate first!

While you're bending down into the shot, do so slowly and controlled. This allows you to validate your alignment with your eyes prior to moving the cue for your [practice strokes.](practice-strokes)

Land your bridge hand and secure the cue, then use your eyes to validate everything looks good. Only once this is complete is it necessary to begin doing your [practice stroke](practice-strokes) routine.


:::warning Enter Quietly!!
Do NOT go from stepping into your stance straight into [practice strokes](practice-strokes) (especially fast, uncontrolled ones!)

This may not seem like something that makes a big difference, but if you watch any pro they will do this. Just by observing this point alone you can tell if a player is a beginning amateur vs a higher skilled or pro player. Pay attention to this.
