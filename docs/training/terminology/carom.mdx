title: "Carom"

## Definition

A carom is what happens when two [object balls](object-ball) collide and the first [object ball](object-ball) travels after collision.

## More specifically:

This can be used intentionally, or it can be coincidental. If you shoot the [cue ball](cue-ball) at an [object ball](object-ball) (OB1) and the [object ball](object-ball) strikes a second [object ball](object-ball) (OB2), the resulting path of OB1 after this collision would be a carom action. You would say OB1 caromed off of OB2.

- It does not matter if you pocket an [object ball](object-ball), or if OB1 collides with anything else, it caromed off of OB2.
